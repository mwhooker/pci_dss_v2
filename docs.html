<p>6.1 Ensure that all system components and software are protected from known vulnerabilities by having the latest vendor-supplied security patches installed. Install critical security patches within one month of release.  Note: An organization may consider applying a risk-based approach to  prioritize their patch installations. For example, by prioritizing critical infrastructure (for example, public-facing devices and systems, databases) higher than less-critical internal devices, to ensure high-priority systems and devices are addressed within one month, and addressing less critical devices and  z </p>

<p>6.2 Establish a process to identify and assign a risk ranking to newly discovered security vulnerabilities.  Notes: ' Risk rankings should be based on  industry best practices.

' The ranking of vulnerabilities as defined in 6.2.a is considered a best practice until June 30, 2012, after which it becomes a requirement. </p>
