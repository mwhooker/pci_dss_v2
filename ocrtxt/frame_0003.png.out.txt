6.2 Establish a process to identify and
assign a risk ranking to newly discovered
security vulnerabilities.

Notes:
' Risk rankings should be based on

industry best practices. For example,
criteria for ranking —High|l risk
vulnerabilities may include a CVSS
base score of4.0 or above, and/or a
vendor-supplied patch classified by
the vendor as —criticaI,|l and/or a
vulnerability affecting a critical
system component.

' The ranking of vulnerabilities as
defined in 6.2.a is considered a best
practice until June 30, 2012, after
which it becomes a requirement.

6.3 Develop software applications
(internal and external, and including web-
based administrative access to
applications) in accordance with PCI DSS
(for example, secure authentication and
logging), and based on industry best
practices. Incorporate information
security throughout the software
development life cycle. These processes
must include the following:
