6.4.5.a Verify that change-control procedures related to
implementing security patches and software modifications are
documented and require items 6.4.5.1 â€” 6.4.5.4 below.

6.4.5.b For a sample of system components and recent
changes/security patches, trace those changes back to related
change control documentation. For each change examined,
perform the following:

6.4.5.1 Verify that documentation of impact is included in the
change control documentation for each sampled change.

6.4.5.2 Verify that documented approval by authorized parties is
present for each sampled change.

6.4.5.3.a For each sampled change, verify that functionality
testing is performed to verify that the change does not adversely
impact the security of the system.

6.4.5.3.b For custom code changes, verify that all updates are
tested for compliance with PCI DSS Requirement 6.5 before being
deployed into production.

6.4.5.4 Verify that back-out procedures are prepared for each
sampled change.

6.5.a Obtain and review software development processes. Verify
that processes require training in secure coding techniques for
developers, based on industry best practices and guidance.

6.5.b Interview a sample of developers and obtain evidence that
they are knowledgeable in secure coding techniques.

6.5.c. Verify that processes are in place to ensure that
applications are not vulnerable to, at a minimum, the following:
